      <p><strong>The curiosity and desire to paint began around the age of five and have self-taught to the present day.</strong>        I am fascinated at how paint can create the illusion of three dimension, light and dark, warmth and cold. I am drawn
        to the way a picture can pull out emotion from the viewer and how you can return to a favourite picture many times
        and still get a sensation from it. </p>
      <p>I was first inspired by the impressionists’ paintings such as Sisley’s landscapes, the pastel sketches of Degas and
        the studies made en plein air by Sorrola. I admire the watercolours of Edward Seago and am constantly inspired by
        the work of Ken Howard. </p>
      <p>I like my paintings to be a journey for the viewer, in order to achieve this, my paintings often show all of the stages
        from the beginning to the completed piece. I enjoy to paint all subjects, however have limited this to Equine and
        Water. My sold pieces show a wide variety of the work I do produce for my customers, along with the large number
        of pieces available in my home studio. </p>
      <p>
        I am producing the pieces shown on the website to sell and to be shown in galleries; but do accept commissions for any subject
        of work.</p>
