        <p><strong>The curiosity and desire to paint began around the age of five and have self-taught to the present day.</strong>          I am fascinated at how paint can create the illusion of three dimension, light and dark, warmth and cold. I am
          drawn to the way a picture can pull out emotion from the viewer and how you can return to a favourite picture many
          times and still get a sensation from it. </p>
        <p>I was first inspired by the impressionists’ paintings such as Sisley’s landscapes, the pastel sketches of Degas and
          the studies made en plein air by Sorrola. I admire the watercolours of Edward Seago and am constantly inspired
          by the work of Ken Howard. </p>
        <p>I like my paintings to be a journey for the viewer, in order to achieve this, my paintings often show all of the
          stages from the beginning to the completed piece. I enjoy to paint all subjects, however have limited this to Equine
          and Water. My sold pieces show a wide variety of the work I do produce for my customers, along with the large number
          of pieces available in my home studio. </p>
        <p>
          I am producing the pieces shown on the website to sell and to be shown in galleries; but do accept commissions for any subject
          of work.</p>
